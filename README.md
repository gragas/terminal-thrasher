# Terminal Thrasher
A commandline interface for skateboarding. _Skate or die!_

# Installing Terminal Thrasher
If you have Go, you can download and install Terminal Thrasher with one command:

`go get github.com/gragas/terminal-thrasher`

If you don't have Go, that sucks. You should really get it. If you don't want to, you can look in the Binaries section for a binary that can run on your platform.

# Running Terminal Thrasher

Run the command `thrash` in any terminal. I sure hope it works.

# Binaries

There aren't any binaries yet. Just get Go already!

### Just Remember

Do whatever the fuck you want with this code!
